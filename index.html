  <h1>What is Github?</h1> 
        
<p>Github is, in essence, a code storing website. A good example of this would be google drive or Microsoft Azure cloud services, but for code. Meaning that whenever you write code, build a project or want to share some kind of code-based idea, Github is your go-to website for sharing and storing that project.</p>

<h2><Assignment Goals/h2>
The goal of this assignment is to help you understand the terminology used on the GitHub website and to help you understand what we will use the site for.  Additionally you will be creating a free account with GitHub.  We recommend that you use a personal email address for this, but you can use your school account if needed as well.

Tasks
Review the following information:

Some terminology on Github:

Watch: Notification options. It offers “Not watching”, “Releases only”, “Watching”, and “Ignoring”.
Stars: Likes on Instagram && thumbs up on Messenger
Fork: Copy and clone the repository (project) to your account. This feature is used to modify the project and it is important when you are coding in a team. The “fork” feature will be discussed in more detail later in this article.
 The Github website that allows you to also like, comment and star other projects from other creators like yourself. So when you fork a project, you are just getting a personal copy of that project to your own account. When you star someone else's project, you are in essence telling them you like the project they made. When you watch something, you're notified when updates or changes come to that project.

Is Github Free?

Yes! Github is free and has a ton to offer without any paid services. They do offer a premium service that will give you these features if you so choose to subscribe:

GitHub Plans (Links to an external site.)

NOTE: You are not required to buy a plan, this is just to show you what plans they offer if you ever need them in the future!

 

Why do we need GitHub?

The reason we need GitHub for this program and for your future projects is because of the excellent storage platform that GitHub is, it provides almost everything you'll need for free. You can create a new account at github.com (Links to an external site.)

Once that is completed you will be able to start building your programming portfolio!!
